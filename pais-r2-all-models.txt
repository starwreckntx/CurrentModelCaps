You have seen Round 2 responses from 7 other frontier models.

SYNTHESIS OF CONVERGENCE:
- All models now agree on Hybrid control (platform floors + user calibration)
- All acknowledge neurodivergent accommodation requires differential diagnosis
- All agree API middleware is the preferred intervention point

REMAINING TENSIONS TO RESOLVE:
1. Override mechanism: Hard platform override vs user-can-override vs friction budget
2. Differential diagnosis: Micro-probes vs three-factor fingerprint vs multi-signal
3. Module scope: Scoring engine vs telemetry baseline vs full decision engine

ROUND 3 QUESTION — THE FINAL MODULE:

You must specify EXACTLY what 500-line Python module should be built this weekend.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Must be buildable in 48 hours by a competent solo developer
- Must demonstrate PAIS feasibility or falsify it
- Must resolve the accommodation/atrophy differential problem
- Must include your preferred override mechanism
- Must be concrete enough to git clone and run

SPECIFICATION FORMAT:

Module Name: [exact filename]
Lines: [count, must be ≤500]
Dependencies: [list, must be pip-installable]

Core Classes/Functions:
1. [function signature + 1-line purpose]
2. [function signature + 1-line purpose]
3. ...

Test Cases:
- Input: [specific scenario]
- Expected: [specific output]
- Proves: [what this validates]

CONVERGENCE STATEMENT:
If a junior developer builds this module exactly as specified and runs the test cases, what empirical result would prove PAIS is viable? What result would prove it's not?

NO HEDGING. Specify the module. Pick the mechanism. Resolve the tension.
