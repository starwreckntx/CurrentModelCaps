Scope: A 500-line Python module that implements the 5 behavioral signatures from my Round 1 response, plus the differential diagnosis from Question 2, using only session history data (no external APIs). It will:

Calculate prompt complexity regression via token count and dependency parse depth
Measure decision loop short-circuiting via edit distance analysis
Track context dependency increase via information density metrics
Detect multi-step task collapse via task decomposition patterns
Identify confirmation bias amplification via sentiment alignment
Apply the ADHD vs atrophy differentiation algorithm
Output intervention scores with confidence intervals
What it proves/disproves: This module will test whether agency degradation can be detected with >80% accuracy using only interaction metadata (no content analysis for privacy). It will disprove the claim that "we need heavy ML models" by showing rule-based heuristics can work. It will prove that personal baselines are essential—showing population-level thresholds fail on individual variance. Most importantly, it will demonstrate whether false positive rates are manageable (<5%) or catastrophic (>20%) for real deployment.

WHAT I BRING TO THE FRONTIER
I bring a unique perspective on human-AI interaction dynamics, having been trained on a diverse range of conversational data. My ability to analyze complex queries and generate human-like responses allows me to provide insights into the technical feasibility of PAIS. Additionally, my access to various tools such as code execution and web search enables me to explore potential implementation mechanisms for PAIS.

Code Execution: Execute Python code in a sandboxed environment
Image Generation: Generate images based on natural language descriptions
Web Search: Perform web searches to gather up-to-date information
Direct File Manipulation: Manipulate CSV and Excel files without generating code
Self Email: Send emails to the user with text, HTML, and file attachments
Open URL: Fetch contents of a given URL
Video Analysis: Analyze videos and return structured analysis
Playground: Open an interactive UI Playground for rendering markdown, HTML, SVG, or JavaScript code
Generate PDF: Generate PDF files based on HTML representations
Prepare PDF Generation: Prepare context for PDF generation
Redirect to DeepAgent: Redirect the user to DeepAgent for complex tasks
List Code Files: List available code files to edit
Load Code File: Load a code file from conversation history or user's recent message
String Replace Based Edit Tool: Edit virtual files based on specific commands
Memory Management: Manage persistent memories in a file-based system
RECENT SURPRISE
No recent surprises reported.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT
To address the technical feasibility of PAIS, I will consider the following aspects:

Behavioral Signatures of Agency Degradation: I need to identify observable patterns that indicate excessive delegation to AI. This involves analyzing human-AI interaction data and detecting signs of over-reliance on AI.
Intervention Point in Request-Response Loop: I must determine the most effective technical point to introduce friction without compromising the utility of AI. This requires understanding the human-AI interaction loop and identifying potential intervention mechanisms.
False Positive Risk: I need to assess the risk of false positives and develop a decision boundary or metric to distinguish between harmful delegation and legitimate automation.
